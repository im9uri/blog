My name is Gyuri. This is my blog where I write about technology, among other things.

I worked in several startups, some of which have been [acquired](http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20120402001033) or [IPO'ed](http://besuccess.com/2014/10/mobile-game-cookie-run-from-devsisters-delivers-pay-day-to-investors-in-secret-ipo/).

I created and maintain a [photo app](https://appsto.re/kr/QP5lib.i), which you can checkout if you have an iPhone.

I studied Computer Science at KAIST.
